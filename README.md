WE LOVE GALAGA SO MUCH WE MEMED IT on BSC

​

Galaga was a viral hit when it burst into arcades back in good ol' 1981. The sequel to 1979's Galaxian, Galaga, which also spawned several sequels of its own, is an intense space shooter. Ported to a bounty of consoles, from the Atari 7800 to Xbox 360, it is likely due to some act of divine intervention if you have yet to play this game. From the so-called Golden Age of Arcade Games, Galaga still enjoys widespread popularity today amongst vintage, rebuilt, and replica coin-operated machines.
